 *   Newtonâ€™s law states that the force, F, between two bodies of masses M1 and
 *   M2 is given by:
 *   F = k M1M2/d2
 * 
 *   n which k is the gravitational constant and d is the distance between the
 *   bodies. The value of k is approximately 6.6710-8 dyn. cm2/g2. 
 *   Write a program that prompts the user to input the masses of the bodies and the
 *   distance between the bodies. The program then outputs the force between
 *   the bodies
